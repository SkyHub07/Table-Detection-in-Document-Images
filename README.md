This Projects detects and recognizes the structure of tables in document images. We have proposed an Deep learing and image processing method. We evaluated our results on ICDAR 2013 dataset.


Install python libraries:
     `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


To run the code :-

	  python3 main.py image_name.png/jpg
	  
	  
terminal will ask the input to set the input of output file, give the name.

extracted table will be saved in "extracted" folder with name as you have given.


for e.g : if image tes.png contains three tables then :

Terminal will ask  output image name :  if your input is tab

then images of tab-1.jpg , tab-2.jpg , tab-3.jpg will be saved in extracted folder.
